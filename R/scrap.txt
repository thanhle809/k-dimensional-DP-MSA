TODO list:
1. To-read:
  - how to write a README file
  - how to organize an R package or a development project
  - search what other packages is my package reliant on
2. To-do:
  - write a function to trace back and create an MSA vizualization using
  - check how this program differs from other EBI MSA programs (why they are different. where in my program gets it wrong)
  - calculating the mean score for each column (need to take the mean of the sum from mismatch, match, gappen)
